Notes
===================

This is a on going (in my spare time) project.  This is a game that I LOVE to play with family and friends! Now I am able to write this game on my own! I am very excited about this project.
Any feed back would be great!

Rules
----
Farkle is a simple dice game that has captured the attention and board-game-time of odds-hounds everywhere.

Farkle Scorekeeper and Determining Who Goes First
Each player rolls one die, with the highest roll going first. In the
event of a tie, the players who tied for the highest roll roll again. Once the first
player is decided, play continues.

Farkle Scoring
You cannot count any of your points until you reach at least 500 points in a single round.
When you reach 500 points for the first time, you may choose to immediately end your turn
to prevent losing the points, OR take your chances and roll again.

>**Points value**
5′s = 50 point
1′s = 100 points
1,1,1 = 300 points
2,2,2 = 200 points
3,3,3 = 300 points
4,4,4 = 400 points
5,5,5 = 500 points
6,6,6 = 600 points
Four of a Kind = 1,000 points
Five of a Kind = 2,000 points
Six of a Kind = 3,000 points
A Straight of 1-6 = 1,500 points
Three Pairs = 1,500 points
Four of a Kind + a Pair = 1,500
Two sets of Three of a Kind = 2,500

Your Turn
On your turn, place all six dice into the dice cup and roll them. If a die falls out of
the play area, re-roll it. Take out any dice worth points after each roll. This forms
your running score for the round. Roll the remaining dice, removing any dice worth
points and adding them to your running total. If you are ever able to set aside all six
dice, you may re-roll all of your dice and keep building your running total. If ever you
are unable to set aside any dice (no dice are worth points), you have Farkled. You lose
your running point total and your turn is over.

Winning the Game
Be the first player to meet or exceed 10,000 points to start the end game sequence.
Each other player has one turn to try to beat your score. After all remaining players
have had their turn, the player with the highest score wins.
